# FlappyBird
This is a personal project that aims to be similar to the game Flappy Bird. I will add formal documentation for this soon. In the meantime, to run:
1. Pick an IDE of your choice and create a new project named "FlappyBird"
2. In the "src" directory, copy all the files from my "src" directory here.
3. Add the "Assets" to the project directory.
4. Run using the "FlappyBird.java" file.
